<h2> Favarite Movie - Raja Rani </h2>
<p> Raja rani is a decent romantic drama. 
    It reiterates that ‘there is love after love failure’ and importantly 
    ‘there is life after love failure’. Arya has done a good job in this movie.
     Jai is good as naive and innocent call centre executive Surya. </p>
