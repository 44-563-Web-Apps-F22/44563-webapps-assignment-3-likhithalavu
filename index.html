    <h2> Favarite Movie - Raja Rani </h2>
    <p> Raja rani is a decent romantic drama. 
    It reiterates that ‘there is love after love failure’ and importantly ‘there is life after love failure’. Arya has done a good job in this movie. Jai is good as naive and innocent call centre executive Surya. </p>
